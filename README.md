# matlabMBody
A multibody dynamics model for satellite attitude dynamics
1) run "model_final_QFB_data" to load the necessary variables and parameters
before running simulink model
2) run "model_final_QFB". The multi-body satellite reorients itself to the 
commanded angles input in the "reference euler angles" constant block
3) observe the output (attitude, panel angels etc.) from the corresponding scopes
